I created extra directory for all the checks which are related to Elasticsearch
querying. All the checks placed here should process the logs/documents
of applications. I feel that it's impossible to create one universal check so
it's better to create more checks which are mainly customer/appication specific.

Do not move here the checks for Elasticsearch status itself.  The are not related.


Any improvements are welcomed! Pavel (kayn)
